It's astonishing just how many things can stay floating around in one's mind for years. Little tidbits, anecdotes. Nuggets of wisdom dispensed by elders and mentors. Personal case studies on how some little discovery helped you communicate better, reduced the mental load of some task, or simply made everything *click*.

This is a blog about software development. Programming, terminals, servers, databases, networking, containers, cloud, CI/CD, open source, web browsers, web frameworks, auth, design tools, AI tools, user interfaces. All of it.

This is also a blog about tech in the world. Tech for business, for career, for personal trivialities, for fitness, for music, for reading, for movies, for news, for banking and payments, for travel and gambling and hosting events and philanthropy and fundraising and meeting people and on and on.

This is also a journal of sorts, in which I'll try to untangle and re-thread some of the tidbits, anecdotes, and nuggets of wisdom that have been brewing over my short twenty-six years. Topics that hold my interest include esoteric spiritual traditions, music, dance, creativity, flow, rock climbing, and high-impact individuals.

## The Future of Tech and Society

Devices and software of all kinds have undoubtedly transformed the lives of almost everyone on Earth in the last 30 years. The open question that everyone is struggling to answer, however, is how we progress from *information overwhelm and social dysfunction* to a more desireable future that looks something like *tech-facilitated security, prosperity, and robustness*. Much of that vision may actually involve having our tech get out of the way so we can be old fashioned human beings more of the time.
