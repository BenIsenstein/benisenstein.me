## Make links and other hover interactions slick with this underline technique

This simple set of CSS rules creates an engaging interaction when hovering over links.

This assumes you've negated all default styles the browser would normally apply to the element in question. See my Browser Style Reset article.

```CSS
a {
    border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0 / 0.2);
    transition: border-bottom 200ms;
}

a:hover {
    border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}
```

In atomic classes like we would use in Tailwind/Uno:

```html
<a class="border-b-1 border-b-black/20 hover:border-b-black transition duration-200">Order Now!</a>
```
